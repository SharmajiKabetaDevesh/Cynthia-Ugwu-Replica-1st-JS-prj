ðŸš€ Just Made my first personal website! ðŸŽ‰

I was thinking that Java and Python where enough for my journey but the industry heated me to learn JavaScript 
so after grinding for a week here I am with a beautiful inspired by an existing website. This project challenged me to apply
my newfound coding skills and turn my vision into reality.

ðŸŒŸ Special thanks to Sheryians Coding School that guided me through the process step by step. 
Learning web development has been an incredible journey, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished.
